The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly: `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`, `text-transparent`, `bg-clip-text`.  This occurs when using these classes together on a single element, resulting in no styling changes.  If the classes are used individually, they function as expected.
